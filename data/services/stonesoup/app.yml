    Enterprise grade build and deployment of managed services.
    # TODO - improve this once Brian writes the service definition in https://issues.redhat.com/browse/HACBS-478
    # Duplicated in data/products/stonesoup/product.yml
    StoneSoup is not onboarding fully on app-interface. It is one of the first services to use the Hybrid SRE model, benefiting from
    a subset of app-interface capabilities.
    This is described in https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/blob/master/docs/stonesoup/support-agreement.md.
