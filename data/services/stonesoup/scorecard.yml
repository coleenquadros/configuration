    exception process.

  status: red
- comment: 'In the case of this service, data management applies as well to the data
    in etcd, not only for the databases, as etcd contains application state. Given
    the automated process to manage the data (for example user management) this is
    marked as red.


    Once that concerned is solved, this control can be marked green as long as the
    services implement backwards compatibility for database schemas (like the gitops
    service) or for any CRs defined by the operators that constitute stonesoup.

- comment: 'All services must expose a prometheus endpoint, exposing relevant data
    and have a dashboard.


    For member clusters, managed as dataplane, SRE needs a way to get all metrics
    as well. Whether that''s config in app-interface or dynamic discovery or metrics
    push to a central location is to be debated.
