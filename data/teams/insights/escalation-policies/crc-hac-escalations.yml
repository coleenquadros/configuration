  In the event that an app-sre engineer cannot resolve the issue in the console.redhat.com Clowder, Ephemeral, or Frontend Operator services, they can escalate to the crc-devprod-team group.

  If there is no response from @crc-devprod-team, escalate to the console.redhat.com Platform oncall via PagerDuty.
