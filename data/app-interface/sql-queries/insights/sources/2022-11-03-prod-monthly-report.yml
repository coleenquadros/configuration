## The queries we run on each block are:                                                 ##

## 1. Count all the sources which use the "account authorization" configuration method.  ##
## 2. Count all the sources which use the "manual configuration" configuration method.   ##
## 3. Count all the sources from the database.                                           ##
## 4. Group sources per source type, and count them.                                     ##
## 5. Group the sources per application type, and count them.                            ##
## 6. Group the applications per application type, and count them.                       ##
##                                                                                       ##
## As per management's request, we filter out the sources and applications that belong   ##
## to QE and developer accounts. More information about this:                            ##
