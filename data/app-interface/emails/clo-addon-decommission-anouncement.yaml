  Hello,

  This is an automated email sent as part of an app-interface merge request[1].

  AppSRE clusters currently use the ClusterLoggingOperator OCM Addon to
  forward logs to the cluster's account CloudWatch. This Addon lacks some
  support and functionalities (e.g., sending logs to RHOBS/Loki). Furthermore, it
  will be deprecated with ADR 58 [2].
  
  AppSRE will migrate from using this Addon to using the standard
  openshift-logging operator.

  With this change, logs will not be sent to the cluster's account CloudWatch
  anymore, but will be made available directly in the "app-sre-logs" account
  (744086762512). This means there will be no need to switch AWS roles anymore
  in order to access your logs: just login on the "app-sre-logs" account. There
  will be one LogGroup for each cluster-namespace. Logs will be shipped to the
  region the cluster is in.

  Your Grafana dashboards using clusters' CloudWatch datasources will need to
  be updated to use the "AWS app-sre-logs" datasource and the new LogGroup.

  This migration unfortunately requires some downtime of log forwarding to
  CloudWatch. This downtime is due to the Addon removal duration and the hive
  synchronization process. This removal process should take less than 30min.
  During this downtime, application logs will only be accessible via pod logs
  (oc logs / console).

  We will start migrating on Monday October, 17th. We will announce cluster
  migrations in the #sd-app-sre channel[3]. You can always refer to the logging
  saas file[4] targets to see if your cluster has the new logging operator
  enabled.

  Please follow these instructions[5] to get access to your application logs.

  In case you need assistance, please consult our FAQ[6] or create a ticket on
  the ASIC Jira board[7].

  Thank you!
