  As part of the efforts of moving Vault inside the Red Hat VPN SDE-1773, we will need to move all current Tekton workloads to a cluster inside the Red Hat VPN (appsrep05ue1).

  We will migrate the Tekton pipelines on Monday, August 22, starting the migration at 09:00 UTC. We don't expect any downtime from the change, and production workloads won't be affected by the changes.

  In case you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach us via @app-sre-ic on #sd-app-sre or via email.

  Thanks,
  The AppSRE team
