  Hello,

  This email is an early notification about the deprecation of PostgreSQL 10 on
  AWS RDS. You are receiving this email because your team has at least one
  database running PostgreSQL 10.

  The final release of PostgreSQL 10 will be on November 10, 2022 [1].
  PostgreSQL 10 will no longer receive bug and security fixes after this date.
  AWS RDS typically forces upgrades to a supported version shortly after the
  final release of a major version of PostgreSQL.

  AppSRE is suggesting that teams running on PostgreSQL 10 begin planning a
  migration effort to a newer major version. We created a page where you can
  read more about the deprecation and the next steps forward [2].

  Please feel free to reach out with any questions or concerns.

  Sincerely,

  The AppSRE Team.
