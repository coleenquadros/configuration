# Status Board

Status Board is a service that allows arbitrary services, integrations,
test-suites and quality tools to report status for their scope. Additionally,
status-board makes this data available in an easy to consume format, for anyone
who derives value from it. For all intents, status-board service targets only
Red Hat workloads, run by and for Red Hat employees, but may also include
services run for customers, by Red Hat teams.

The Status Board project is hosted in [Status Board Git Repository](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/status-board).
