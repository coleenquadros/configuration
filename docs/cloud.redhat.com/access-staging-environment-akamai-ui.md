# Accessing console.redhat.com Staging Environment

Note: This SOP is not for accessing the OpenShift cluster but the UI & c.rh.c services running in staging environment.

The staging environment can be accessed at https://cloud.stage.redhat.com/. You will need to use the squid proxy to access Akamai preprod domains over VPN. Instructions to setup squid proxy can be found [here](https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-1213497).
